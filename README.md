# Smart-Bike-Lock
The project can be used to lock and unlock the bike remotely, as well as check the status of the lock.
This project is a smart bike lock that uses an Arduino Nano 33 IoT and an ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. The Arduino Nano 33 IoT is responsible for controlling the lock and the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module is responsible for connecting to the internet. The project can be used to lock and unlock the bike remotely, as well as check the status of the lock.

The project uses the Arduino IDE and the ArduinoJson library.
The project is open source and can be found on GitHub.
The project is designed to be easy to use and can be modified to meet your specific needs.

This code is for a smart bike lock project that uses an Arduino Nano 33 IoT and an ESP8266 Wi-Fi module.

The Arduino Nano 33 IoT is responsible for controlling the lock and the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module is responsible for connecting to the internet.

The code first connects the Arduino Nano 33 IoT to the Wi-Fi network.

Once the Arduino Nano 33 IoT is connected to the Wi-Fi network, it will start listening for commands from the internet.

When the Arduino Nano 33 IoT receives a command, it will execute the command and send a response back to the internet.

The commands that the Arduino Nano 33 IoT can execute are:

 * Lock the bike

 * Unlock the bike

 * Check the status of the lock

The Arduino Nano 33 IoT will send a response back to the internet indicating whether the command was successful or not.

The following is the code for the smart bike lock project
